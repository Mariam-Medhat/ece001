<h2 class="auto-style2">Characteristics Of Big Data</h2>
<p><strong><em>(<span class="auto-style3">i) Volume –</span></em></strong><span class="auto-style3">&nbsp;The 
name Big Data itself is related to a size which is enormous. Size of data plays 
a very crucial role in determining value out of data. Also, whether a particular 
data can actually be considered as a Big Data or not, is dependent upon the 
volume of data. Hence,&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="auto-style3">'Volume'</span></strong><span class="auto-style3">&nbsp;is 
one characteristic which needs to be considered while dealing with Big Data.
</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span class="auto-style3">(ii) Variety –</span></em></strong><span class="auto-style3">&nbsp;The 
next aspect of Big Data is its&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="auto-style3">variety</span></strong><span class="auto-style3">.
</span></p>
<p class="auto-style3">Variety refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of 
data, both structured and unstructured. During earlier days, spreadsheets and 
databases were the only sources of data considered by most of the applications. 
Nowadays, data in the form of emails, photos, videos, monitoring devices, PDFs, 
audio, etc. are also being considered in the analysis applications. This variety 
of unstructured data poses certain issues for storage, mining and analyzing 
data. </p>
<p><strong><em><span class="auto-style3">(iii) Velocity –</span></em></strong><span class="auto-style3">&nbsp;The 
term&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="auto-style3">'velocity'</span></strong><span class="auto-style3">&nbsp;refers 
to the speed of generation of data. How fast the data is generated and processed 
to meet the demands, determines real potential in the data. </span></p>
<p class="auto-style3">Big Data Velocity deals with the speed at which data 
flows in from sources like business processes, application logs, networks, and 
social media sites, sensors, mobile devices, etc. The flow of data is massive 
and continuous. </p>
<p><strong><em><span class="auto-style3">(iv) Variability –</span></em></strong><span class="auto-style3">&nbsp;This 
refers to the inconsistency which can be shown by the data at times, thus 
hampering the process of being able to handle and manage the data effectively.
